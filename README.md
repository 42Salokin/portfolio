# My Development Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio of work to showcase my projects and skills. Using what I've learned so far about HTML and CSS, I put links in the header to scroll to the relevant About Me, Work, and Contact Me sections. The screenshot of my first project will take you to the deployed website. I'll be adding more projects as I go.
